# Jake’s guide to how to make money selling AI/ML

# Who am I?
- 9 years client-facing data scientist consultant, picked up MLOps later.
- 50% time spent selling DS projects… because I saw too many failed projects from poor sales
    - I know the pain of poor scoping, so I try not to subject others to that pain

# Why am I putting this together?
- Because I have a horrible memory so I need notes to remind myself of what I've learned.
- Because I have learned some things the hard way which some DS might find helpful.

# Highlights
- The most important question a Data Scientist should ask is **so what**... you have a good model, so what?
- Cloud revenue comes from data infra, not from AI/ML infra
- Dangle latest AI
- Problems before solutions
- AI requires domain expertise and industrial language
    - Must use customer’s language
- Get upstream of sales pipeline

# Random notes
## Mistakes made, lessons learned
- Trying to sell solutions, not addressing business goals
    - Lesson: hide any technical discussion until calls 2 or 3
- Moment: not being able to articulate how my models would impact their bottom line
    - Learning: Not having enough domain expertise
    - Action: industry-specific language is key
- Sell problems, not solutions
- Sell with industry-specific language and use cases
    - AI is not sold to IT, it’s sold to business

## Sales
- Our team’s goal is platform spend (obviously).
- Friends buy from friends, and friends help each other succeed.
    - While we may not be able to help the stakeholder personally (yet), we may be able to help their careers. In general this means helping the stakeholder help their customers, both internal and external.
    - Thus helping our stakeholder help their customers (help their customers) = they get paid = we get paid
        - How does our stakeholder get paid?
- If our stakeholder gets paid more than they me us i.e. positive ROI, then paying us is an obvious choice.
    - How do we determine how much they’ll get paid i.e. the return?
    - How do we determine how much they’ll pay us i.e. the investment?

## AI
- Our team’s goal is entire platform spend, not just AI.
- AI is not money maker, DM is money maker. This is because “Data has gravity”.
- Thus makes the most sense to dangle latest AI to drive data gravity
    - How to ensure both short and long-term commitment?
- AI is a long-term play.
    - ROI-generating AI requires end user buy-in (UAT), data at scale (multiple teams, multiple warehouses), in production (DevOps, security)

# Part 1: Building a pipeline
## How to identify use cases?
- Easy: what are processes that a human can do within 3 seconds?
    - These are boring, tedious, prone to error, and ripe for automation.
- Medium: ask the above but for the customer’s customer.
- Hard: where is the industry going? Requires domain expertise
    - IoT 4, sustainability, efficiency

# Part 2: Prioritizing pipeline
## How to prioritize use cases
1. Business: Why should this project be done? How will it make money? Who is buying?
2. Technical: What data is needed? What model is used? How will the end user gain value? How will it all get piped together?
3. Operational: Who will own and maintain the code? How will value be realized?

## Discovery workshop agenda
Hour 1: Voice of customer
Hour 2: Business process understanding (we'll listen in for use cases here)
Hour 3: Use case deep dive, ROI justification, prioritization/triage
Hour 4: Technical deep dive, next steps

# How does our stakeholder get paid?
Value chain
- Organization:
    - What is their business model?
        - If B2C: Who is the end customer?
        - If B2B: Who is their end customer?
    - Domain expertise is key
- Personal: metrics
    - Step into their shoes
    - Validate pain points
    - Confirm prescriptions
- Team: connect the dots
- Bonus: personal aspirations
- Beware some DS can be defensive. Stress that you’re not here for their job and are only here to empower them
    - “1) you know more about your data than I do and 2) I’m very happy here at Google. I’m simply here to see if GCP can help you do your job easier.”

# How do we determine ROI?
## Determining return
- Past use cases
- DS metrics → industry-specific metric
    - Precision and recall in industry terms
- Parallel long-term short-term path

## Determining investment
- Underlying
- Implementation
    - Internal: training, opportunity cost, new hires
    - Partner inc. GCC: high bill rate, PM overhead

# 2 path for stickiness
- Short-term AI POC, target long-term digital transformation
    - Depends on data migration for full scalability
- Short-term DA, target long-term data migration
    - This is money maker for GCP
